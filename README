************************** CMS mock API **************************

This project relies on locally-running mock CMS API, available at:
https://bitbucket.org/apurvkumaria/cdi-cms-mock-api
This CMS API runs at localhost:4567



************************* Database setup *************************

In order to generate the databases, your computer must have the 'mysql' command line interface installed.

Database configuration:
Default is database running at localhost:3306 with user 'root' and password 'rootpass'
Customize your database configuration in:
db/migrations/environments/development.properties
main/resources/database.properties

Initializing databases: Note that both of these database steps totally drop databases and reinit.
To initialize mock CMS database:
./gradlew createCMSDB

To initialize build database:
./gradlew initDB
(Runs all migrations and loads some data from irrelevant backup)



*********************** Database migrations ***********************

MyBatis database migrations:
cd db/migrations
mybatis/bin/migrate new "migration name here"
-enter migration text into file generated in db/migrations/scripts-
mybatis/bin/migrate up



********************** Running the application **********************

To run 'Main', demonstrating capabilities and starting up web services:
./gradlew clean build bootRun

The produced API will run at localhost:8080
