Dependent on locally-running mock CMS API, available at:
https://bitbucket.org/apurvkumaria/cdi-cms-mock-api
This CMS API runs at localhost:4567

Depends on MySQL local setup. Currently requires 'root' user with password 'rootpass'.

To initialize mock CMS database:
./gradlew createCMSDB

To initialize build database:
./gradlew initDB
(Runs migrations and loads some data from irrelevant backup)

Note that both of these database steps totally drop databases and reinitialize.

To run 'Main', demonstrating capabilities and starting up web services:
./gradlew clean build bootRun

Runs at localhost:8080

MyBatis database migrations:
cd db/migrations
mybatis/bin/migrate new "migration name here"
-enter migration text into file generated in db/migrations/scripts-
mybatis/bin/migrate up
